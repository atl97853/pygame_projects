How pygame draws on the screen

Display Surface:
It's like a blank Canvas.
We can only have one per game. 

It's created when we call the set_mode() function and it's object:
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((300, 600))

and we used it when we call the update() function: 
pygame.display.update()

Surface:
Another type of blank Canvas.
We can only many surfaces per game. 

Rect: 
Rectangles are used for positioning, collision detection and for drawing objects.
